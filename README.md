**Arxitest: Intelligent Test Automation Platform**

**Brief description**

Arxitest is a SaaS-based, enterprise-ready test automation platform that
streamlines the software testing lifecycle by automating test creation,
containerizing test execution, and providing centralized reporting. With
deep integration to Jira, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for
generating test scripts, and support for frameworks like Selenium
(Python) and Cypress, Arxitest helps teams---especially those new to
testing---rapidly establish and scale their QA processes. The platform's
pay-as-you-go subscription model ensures you only pay for the resources
you use, reducing upfront costs and simplifying budgeting.

**Core Platform Capabilities**

1\. Test Generation and Management

- AI-Assisted Test Creation

  - Arxitest integrates with a fine-tuned LLAMA model to parse Jira user
    stories, acceptance criteria, and test data, automatically
    generating draft test scripts. For now, we consider that LLAMA is
    already existing.

  - Support for Selenium in Python and Cypress ensures coverage of
    modern web applications.

- Human Oversight and Editing

  - After generation, test scripts can be edited within the platform to
    handle edge cases or project-specific logic.

  - Version control integration tracks changes, allowing you to roll
    back or compare different script iterations.

- Beginner-Friendly Guidance

  - Detailed in-platform tutorials and documentation outline best
    practices for structuring tests, managing test data, and writing
    assertions.

  - Automated "starter templates" for common testing scenarios (e.g.,
    login pages, CRUD operations).

2\. Execution Infrastructure

- Containerized Execution

  - Each test run is launched in an isolated Docker container, providing
    consistent and reproducible environments across teams and sprints.

  - Preconfigured images come with all necessary dependencies, including
    the chosen testing framework (e.g., Selenium libraries, Cypress
    runtime).

- Resource Allocation and Monitoring

  - Arxitest's microservices architecture allows granular control over
    container resource usage (CPU, RAM).

  - Real-time dashboards display container health and test progress,
    ensuring quick visibility into any performance bottlenecks.

- Parallel Test Runs

  - Run multiple containers simultaneously to speed up test cycles.

  - Intelligent scheduler optimizes container usage to balance cost and
    performance on the pay-as-you-go model.

- Automated Cleanup and Recovery

  - Once test execution completes, containers shut down automatically,
    freeing resources and reducing expenses.

  - Built-in fault tolerance restarts or reschedules failing containers
    if an unexpected error occurs.

3\. Integration Framework

- Deep Jira Integration

  - Bidirectional synchronization with Jira via REST APIs.

  - Automatically fetch user stories and acceptance criteria for test
    generation.

  - Results can be pushed back to Jira with a single click, linking to
    relevant user stories.

- APIs and Webhooks

  - A comprehensive REST API allows external systems (e.g., CI/CD tools)
    to trigger test runs, retrieve results, and manage containers.

  - Optional webhook callbacks for events such as test completion or
    container failures.

- Version Control Support

  - Integrations with major Git platforms enable you to store and manage
    your test scripts in a familiar repository structure.

  - Commit hooks can automatically trigger updates or notify team
    members when new tests are generated.

4\. Results Management and Analytics

- Real-Time Monitoring

  - A visual dashboard displays ongoing test runs, container statuses,
    and resource usage.

  - Email notifications are sent upon test completion or unexpected
    container failure, ensuring stakeholders stay informed.

- Detailed Reporting

  - Each test run produces execution logs and test metrics, which can be
    stored within Arxitest or exported for manual analysis.

  - Failure analysis highlights which steps or assertions failed,
    linking them back to the relevant Jira user story.

- Historical Trend Analysis

  - Past execution data is retained for insights into pass/fail rates,
    test execution times, and defect density across multiple sprints.

  - Visual charts help teams identify recurring issues or regressions
    over time.

- Manual Log Handling

  - Logs and artifacts (e.g., screenshots) are available for manual
    download or inspection. Arxitest does not mandate an external
    logging/monitoring solution, keeping things straightforward for new
    testing teams.

Technical Architecture

1\. Core Components

1.  Test Management Service

    - Stores test cases, tracks version changes, and maintains mappings
      to Jira stories.

    - Manages the LLM-based script generation process.

2.  Execution Engine

    - Spins up Docker containers on demand, orchestrating concurrency
      and resource utilization.

    - Monitors container health and handles auto-recovery if needed.

3.  Results Service

    - Collects and processes test outcomes, logs, and performance
      metrics from each container.

    - Feeds data to the reporting and analytics layer for visual
      dashboards.

4.  Integration Hub

    - Manages external communications (Jira REST API, third-party CI/CD
      tools, version control systems).

    - Exposes Arxitest's REST APIs for programmatic control.

2\. Security and Access Control

- OAuth/JWT Authentication

  - Ensures secure access, allowing multiple teams to use Arxitest
    concurrently with role-based permissions.

- Container Isolation

  - Each container operates in a sandboxed environment, preventing
    interference between test runs.

  - Minimal overhead approach ensures consistency without the complexity
    of full-blown Kubernetes (though future expansions are possible).

- Encrypted Communication

  - All sensitive data (e.g., credentials, tokens) is encrypted in
    transit, meeting basic enterprise security standards.

  - Optional integration with secure vaults for storing secrets.

3\. Scalability and Performance

- Horizontal Scalability

  - Spin up additional container hosts to handle peak loads, enabling
    near-linear scalability for parallel test runs.

  - Pay-as-you-go ensures costs scale only as usage increases.

- Load-Balanced Services

  - API gateways and internal microservices use load balancing to handle
    concurrent user requests and container spin-ups.

  - Efficient caching for repeated queries (e.g., repeated Jira lookups)
    speeds up performance.

Implementation Process

1\. Initial Setup

1.  Environment Assessment

    - Confirm the organization's cloud or on-premise environment
      supports Docker.

    - Identify required integrations (Jira, version control, etc.) and
      gather access tokens or keys.

2.  Security Configuration

    - Configure user roles, permissions, and single sign-on (SSO) if
      desired.

    - Establish encryption and container isolation settings.

3.  User and Team Onboarding

    - Provide basic training on container usage, LLM-based test
      generation, and best practices for editing auto-generated scripts.

    - Assign roles and privileges within Arxitest.

4.  Initial LLM Fine-Tuning (Optional)

    - Prepare any domain-specific data if you plan to extend or refine
      the LLAMA model.

    - Conduct a pilot run of the LLM for your first set of user stories.

2\. Test Migration and Creation

- Initial AI-Generated Tests

  - Gather user stories from Jira for the current sprint.

  - Use Arxitest's LLM-based generator to create draft scripts, which
    can be reviewed and refined by QA or developers.

- Test Data Strategy

  - Determine how test data (e.g., credentials, environment variables)
    is managed within Docker containers.

  - Configure environment variables or secrets in Arxitest to be
    injected at runtime.

3\. Operational Phase

1.  Requirement Synchronization

    - Continuously fetch updated user stories from Jira.

    - Highlight changes that might impact existing test coverage.

2.  Execution Management

    - Launch containers for scheduled or on-demand test runs.

    - Monitor container usage to optimize costs under the pay-as-you-go
      model.

3.  Results and Reporting

    - Analyze real-time execution status from the dashboard.

    - Push results back to Jira with a single click for quick
      stakeholder visibility.

    - Receive automated email notifications on test completion or
      container failures.

4.  Maintenance and Optimization

    - Keep containers updated with new framework versions as needed
      (e.g., Selenium or Cypress updates).

    - Archive older test runs and logs, freeing up storage resources.
